## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

### Continued development

I need to adjust my perspective a bit. My approach with Tailwind isn’t completely wrong, but it could be better. I should start thinking more in terms of atomicity, using a component-based approach and atomic design principles. For example, I should probably create components like Button, Title, Paragraph, and so on. I’m considering trying Storybook, even if it feels a bit overkill, but after all, we’re here to practice and learn new things.
